## What is a Address Bus ?

A computer bus architecture known as an address bus is used to transfer data between devices that are identified by their physical memory hardware address, which is stored in the form of binary numbers to enable the data bus to access memory storage. As with the data bus, each wire in an address bus carries a single bit of information.
