Also called a RAM drive, a RAM disk is a virtual storage drive that you can create in Windows with 3rd-party software. Basically, you're telling your PC to reserve a portion of your RAM (eg, your DDR4 memory) as storage space so you can read/write to it like you would an HDD or SSD. RAM can be up to 10 times as fast as the best SSDs.
